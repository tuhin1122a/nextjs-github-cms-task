# 📝 Evaluation Criteria

This project was implemented keeping in mind the following evaluation criteria:

---

## 🔹 Problem Framing & Judgment

- The assignment brief was broken down into clear deliverables: **GitHub integration**, **local draft management**, and **publishing flows**.
- API design was mapped to three endpoints:
  - `/api/drafts` → Fetch all drafts
  - `/api/publish` → Publish all drafts
  - `/api/publish-draft` → Publish a single draft
- Clear separation of responsibilities ensured maintainability.

---

## 🔹 Code Quality, Structure & Maintainability

- **Modular folder structure** with `components`, `hooks`, and `api` routes separated.
- Custom hooks (`useDrafts`, `useGitHubFiles`) for stateful logic reuse.
- Clean, commented code with **separation of concerns** and readability.

---

## 🔹 API Integration Correctness & Security Hygiene

- **GitHub API calls proxied** via Next.js API routes (no direct client-side calls).
- Sensitive tokens stored securely in `.env.local` (never exposed to client).
- Input validation and proper error handling implemented in API routes.

---

## 🔹 UX Clarity for Authoring/Publishing Flow

- Intuitive **form for creating/editing drafts**.
- **Drag-and-drop support** for publishing single drafts.
- **Confirmation modals** before publishing/deleting drafts.
- Clear **toast notifications** for success and error handling.

---

## 🔹 Performance & Accessibility

- Optimized data fetching with **caching and refetching**.
- Minimal re-renders through isolated state management.
- **Semantic HTML** and **ARIA labels** applied to the form.
- Basic **keyboard navigation support** for form interactions (adding and deleting drafts).

---

## 🔹 Documentation Quality & Deployment Readiness

- Detailed **README.md** with setup, usage, API docs, and troubleshooting.
- `.env.example` provided for environment configuration.
- Fully deployed and tested on **Vercel** for production readiness.

---

## ✨ Features

- **GitHub Integration**: Fetch, display, and preview Markdown content directly from GitHub repositories.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuhin1122a/nextjs-github-cms-task
cd nextjs-github-cms-task
npm install
````

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# GitHub Configuration
GITHUB_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_OWNER=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_BRANCH=

```

### 3. GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with these scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `public_repo` (Access to public repositories)
3. Copy the token to your `.env.local` file

### 4. Repository Structure

Your content repository should have a structure like:

```
your-content-repo/
├── drafts/
│   ├── hello.md
│   ├── about.md
│   └── posts/
│       ├── first-post.md
│       └── second-post.md
└── README.md
```

### 5. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Environment Variables

- GitHub token is stored server-side only
- Public environment variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Sensitive operations are handled through API routes

### API Security

- Rate limiting considerations for GitHub API
- Error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Validation of user inputs before GitHub operations

### Best Practices

- Tokens are never exposed to the client
- GitHub operations are authenticated server-side
- Proper error boundaries and loading states

## 🚀 Deployment

# 🔧 API Endpoints

The application exposes three main API endpoints for interacting with drafts and publishing content to GitHub.

---

## 1️⃣ GET `/api/drafts`

Fetch all drafts from the GitHub repository.

**Query Parameters (optional):**

- `path`: Specific file path to fetch, e.g., `drafts/hello.md`. Defaults to fetching all drafts in the `drafts/` folder.

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "hello.md",
      "path": "drafts/hello.md",
      "content": "# Hello World\nThis is a markdown draft.",
      "sha": "3b2e1f..."
    },
    {
      "name": "about.md",
      "path": "drafts/about.md",
      "content": "## About\nSome about content.",
      "sha": "7a8c9d..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2️⃣ POST `/api/publish`

Publish multiple drafts to GitHub at once (bulk publish).

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "drafts": [
    {
      "id": "draft-id-1",
      "title": "First Draft",
      "body": "Content of the first draft..."
    },
    {
      "id": "draft-id-2",
      "title": "Second Draft",
      "body": "Content of the second draft..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response Example**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "2 drafts published successfully",
  "publishedFiles": ["drafts/first-draft.md", "drafts/second-draft.md"]
}
```

## 2️⃣ POST `/appublish-draftsh`

**Request Body:**

```json
    {
      "id": "draft-id-1",
      "title": "First Draft",
      "body": "Content of the first draft..."
    },
```

**Response Example**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "\"First Draft\" published successfully",
  "publishedFile": "drafts/first-draft.md"
}
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling

- Modify `app/globals.css` for global styles
- Update `tailwind.config.js` for custom design tokens
- Components use Tailwind utility classes

### GitHub Integration

- Change repository structure by updating environment variables
- Modify content fetching logic in `lib/api.js`
- Customize markdown rendering in components

## 🔍 Performance & Accessibility

### Performance

- **Static Generation**: Content pages are statically generated when possible
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting with Next.js
- **API Caching**: Appropriate caching headers for GitHub API responses

### Accessibility

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and semantic elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Basic keyboard accessibility for creating and deleting drafts using the form (Enter key to submit, Delete key to remove). Full navigation across all UI elements is not implemented.

- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators from input button

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GitHub API Rate Limits**:

   - Use authenticated requests (they have higher limits)
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed content

2. **Environment Variables**:

   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Restart development server after changes

3. **GitHub Token Permissions**:
   - Verify token has correct repository access
   - Check token expiration date

### Error Messages

- `401 Unauthorized`: Check GitHub token validity
- `404 Not Found`: Verify repository and file paths
- `403 Forbidden`: Token may lack required permissions
